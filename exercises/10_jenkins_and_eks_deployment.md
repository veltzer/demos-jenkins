The idea of this exercise is to have a Jenkins pipeline that deploys a kubernetes application
on an EKS cluster.

Phase1 - deploy an EKS cluster and being able to talk to it using kubectl

link - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started.html

* create an eks cluster with a minimum number of machine.
	We will need at least 3.
	You may need to install 'eksctl' for that.

* talk to the cluster with kubectl
	That means you need to get to a situation that you are able to run these commands,
	and you see that no pods or services are currently deployed...
	$ kubectl get services                          # List all services in the namespace
	$ kubectl get pods --all-namespaces             # List all pods in all namespaces
	$ kubectl get pods -o wide             

Phase2 - learn how to deploy nginx to a k8s cluster and deploy one pod with nginx to the cluster
	*MANUALLY*
	Use kubectl for this
	See that you ngnix pod is running by connecting to it with a browser.
	Undeploy your pod

Phase3 - use a jenkins pipeline (freestyle) to do the same thing you did in phase2 but not manually
	but rather from a Jenkins project.

Phase4 - In this phase deploy *TWO* nginx pods and ask k8s to create a "service" with a load balancer
	to load balance the traffic between the two pods.
	All of this needs to be done from a Jenkins project (ofcourse).
